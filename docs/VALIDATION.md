# Validation record

Date: 2026-09-09. Tested implementation commit: `f83dba4f576298ca0fccda09ce2d73e09ef2840d`.

| Environment | Result | Scope |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Windows, PHP CLI 8.3.32 | 68 policy/integration checks passed | Directory synchronization injected; other journal operations real; fake action executors |
| Windows, PHP CLI 8.3.32 | 10 FastCGI checks passed | Loopback test servers; valid, malformed, oversized, truncated and delayed responses |
| pfSense CE 2.8.1, PHP CLI 8.3.19 | 68 policy/integration checks passed | Native file and directory fsync; fake action executors |
| pfSense CE 2.8.1, PHP CLI 8.3.19 | 10 FastCGI checks passed | Same loopback adversarial transport fixtures |
| pfSense CE 2.8.1, live PHP-FPM Unix socket | Challenge matched, exit 0 | Passive real service transaction with script outside the web document root |

The integration total includes 38 policy checks. It is not 68 plus 38. All PHP source, test and example files also passed syntax checks.

This evidence does **not** demonstrate actual service repair, real reboot persistence, package lifecycle, current pfSense development-version compatibility, hardware-watchdog operation or official repository acceptance. Those remain required and are tracked in [ACCEPTANCE.md](ACCEPTANCE.md).

No production service was restarted and no active recovery supervisor was installed during this validation. No hosted GitHub Actions run has been performed; its workflow currently exists only as a template because the publishing credential cannot write active workflows.
